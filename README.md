The entire program is written in Python, so it is advisable to install the Python first if you have not. I suggest you install Python 3.7 or older. You can download python via https://www.python.org/downloads/.


Once you have a Python install you need (make sure you set your environment variable too) to navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the source code.
Now open the terminal in that folder and type

python poker.py

To run the file.


If you wish to change the file, change the file_name (“./data/file_name.txt’’) in the test_file_for_input variable (line number 351 in the code [poker.py]). Here, the file_name.txt is your file which you want to use.
